I wrote a web app in SML. It sucked. I posted a long post-mortem at
https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150529217696995 but the gist
was that I think the features of Haskell are really what I want for writing
web apps, even if I like SML better as a language. This pretty simple
to-do list is my attempt to see if that is actually the case.


Required packages via cabal-install:
aeson
acid-state
blaze-html
Crypto
dataenc
happstack
happstack-lite
ixset
